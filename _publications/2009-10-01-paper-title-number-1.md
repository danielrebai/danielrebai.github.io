The effect of the intense transport of lightweight sediment without turbulent suspension (Shields numbers of mixture flow from 0.34 to 1.80) on resistance and surface elevation of water flow in an open channel is experimentally examined. Flows over fixed and mobile plane beds, at the same water flowrate and bed slope, are compared. Detailed measurements—including distributions of solids and velocity—permit to identify flow interfaces and determine the role of sediment transport on flow resistance. Two friction factors for mobile bed flows are introduced: one for water only and another one for the mixture. The first seems to be insensitive to the water submergence, while the latter follows the classic formula for the hydraulically rough regime: both increase with respect to the equivalent clear water flow. The water surface elevation seems unaltered by the presence of sediment transport, thus reducing the need for the modelling of the evolution of an erodible bed surface in, at least, some routine applications in fluvial hydraulics.

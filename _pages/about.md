I am Daniel Rebai, currently a Research Associate at the Institut f√ºr Wasser und Umwelt at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. My research focuses on river hydraulics, particularly plastic transport, sediment transport, and turbulence. Experimentalist at heart, the reader of "the proof is left to the reader" in my free time.

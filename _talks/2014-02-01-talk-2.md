We experimentally investigated the effect of particle shape on saltation over a smooth bed. The particle shapes considered included spheres, ellipsoids, ellipsoidal cylinders, and prisms, all having the same weight and nominal diameter. The Coreyâ€™s shape factor, varied from 0.2 (deformed prism) to 1 (sphere). We studied its effects on several Lagrangian indicators. The probability distribution function (pdf) of the streamwise velocity u transitions from Gaussian-like (SF=1) to gamma-like as the shape factor decreases. Specifically, the mean and variance of u increase and decrease, respectively, with increasing shape factor. The pdf of the transversal velocity v remains Gaussian-like, with zero mean, and its variance shows a negative correlation with the shape factor. The autocorrelation function of u is independent of the shape factor, with an average integral time scale of 0.5 s. In contrast, the autocorrelation function of v depends on the shape factor. We also computed the streamwise and transversal mean square displacements. In the streamwise direction, the behaviour is consistently super-diffusive, with an exponent of 0.83 for t<1 s and 0.63 for larger times. In the transversal direction, diffusion is normal for t>1 s. At small time scales, the diffusion regime is normal for low shape factors and super-diffusive for high shape factors.
